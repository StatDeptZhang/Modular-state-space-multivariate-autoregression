# Modular State-Space Multivariate Auto-Regressive Model

## Description

We develop these functions to implement the algorithm described in our paper *Mapping Epileptic Directional Brain Networks Using Intracranial EEG Data*, submitted
to *Biostatistics*. We also include a control panel (ContPanel.m) and the simulated data we used in our paper to help readers understand the usages of the functions, reproduce the results of the simulation study, and do analysis on their own data.


## Installation

Please download all the functions and add them to path before using any of them. You may also put all the functions in your working directory. 

We use the following "VAR Toolbox" for calculating the initial values of **A**: [Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, 2015. "VAR Toolbox"](https://sites.google.com/site/ambropo/).

## Usage

Detailed guidelines on using these functions can be found in MSSMAR\_manual.pdf.
